# C Program Generator

C Program Generator is a program written in C that can generate C code based on user input. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user input and generate code snippets based on a library of existing code.

## Getting Started

To use the C Program Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies.
3. Run the program using `./program_generator <input_text>` where `input_text` is the text you want to generate code for.
4. The generated code will be saved in a file named `<generation no.>.c` in the `generated_code` directory.

## Features

* Natural language processing (NLP) for text analysis.
* Library of pre-written C code snippets.
* Ability to generate code based on user input.
* User-friendly command line interface.

## Examples

Here are some examples of text inputs and the corresponding code generated by the C Program Generator:

### Example 1
Input Text: Create a C program to find the factorial of a given number.

Generated Code:
"#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int n, i;
   unsigned long long factorial = 1;

   printf("Enter an integer: ");
   scanf("%d", &n);

   // error if the user enters a negative integer
   if (n < 0)
      printf("Error: Factorial of a negative number doesn't exist.");
   else {
      for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
         factorial *= i;
      }
      printf("Factorial of %d = %llu", n, factorial);
   }

   return 0;
}"

### Example 2
Input Text: Create a C program to reverse a string.

Generated Code:
"#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
   char str[100], temp;
   int i, j = 0;

   printf("Enter a string: ");
   fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);

   i = 0;
   j = strlen(str) - 1;

   while (i < j) {
      temp = str[i];
      str[i] = str[j];
      str[j] = temp;
      i++;
      j--;
   }

   printf("Reversed string is: %s", str);

   return 0;
}"
